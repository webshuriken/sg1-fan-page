# Stargate Fan Made Page

Fan made page for Stargate (SG1) tv series, a show that I loved growing up.

## About

This page was a 1 week challenge set by [@cbccss](https://twitter.com/cbccss).
The goal, to create a fan made site of a tv show or movie of our choosing.

As a big fan of Stargate SG1, all of the series, I went for it.

## Features

Really enjoyed coding these two features, specially the carousel as it was a bit more challenging.

**Flip card** for the characters section.
Each person gets their own card with the profile picture at the front and a
little bio at the back. JS is only used to toggle between class names.

**Endless Carousel** for the vehicles section.
Created a custom endless carousel to show case the vehicles from the show.
Could not find somewhere to guide me on this and the other options was to use
Bootstrap (but did not want to add it just for this) so I created it fresh.

I use JS to keep track of the slide on show and to toggle between animations.
It uses translate and opacity which does not mess with Paint on a browser to
make smooth transitions.

project can be used straight away.
